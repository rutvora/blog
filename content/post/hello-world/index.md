Hey! Welcome to "Root Access"!

Before we get to the complicated stuff, I want to introduce myself and this blog.

Well, I am a student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) pursuing a MS (Thesis) in Computer Science. I did my undergraduate at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) (2016-2020) and jumped into the network industry. I worked as a Software Engineer in the Office of the CTO (fondly called OCTO) at [F5 Networks](https://f5.com/) from 2020-2022. The projects that I undertook there involve a broad range of the latest and next-generation technologies. Jargons like WebAssembly, SmartNIC, DDoS protection, eBPF, DPDK etc., were what I heard every day! And it's pretty easy to get lost in all of these.

Coming to this blog, I chose the name "Root Access" because it's a pun on my name. Also, because this blog (hopefully) provides you with a good enough introduction to techno-babble, so that you can then have the skill (privilege) to access the more profound knowledge. But mostly because it's a pun.

This blog will mostly contain posts that explain the latest or complicated technologies from scratch and hopefully help you understand the latest industry jargon.

NOTE: These posts are a compilation of my understanding of the technology. I am no expert, and as such, these blogs may not be 100% accurate. Please let me know if you find any corrections or have suggestions.
